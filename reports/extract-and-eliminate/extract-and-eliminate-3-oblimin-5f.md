# Phase 2
After analysing the remaining 44 items retained in phase 1, we have decided to exclude itmes that showed small (less than ~.40) loadings across rotations. The following items has been eliminated during phase 2 of the analysis:  

- item 31

> Vaginal tearing during labour/birth?


- item 32

> Rectal tearing/damage as a consequence of labour/birth?


- item 46

> Needing to have stitches after the birth?
