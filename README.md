# Abstract
Fear of childbirth affects as many as 30% of women, and has been associated with pregnancy termination, increased pain perception during childbirth, prolonged labour, increased risk of emergency and elective cesarean delivery, postnatal depression and posttraumatic stress disorder, and poor maternal-infant bonding. Currently available measures of fear of childbirth fail to fully capture women’s childbirth-related fears (i.e., important content domains of fear have been excluded). The purpose of this research was to develop a new measure of fear of childbirth (the Childbirth Fear Questionnaire; CFQ) that would address the limitations of existing measures. Participants were 643 pregnant women residing in English speaking countries, and were recruited via online forums. Participants completed a set of questionnaires, including the CFQ, via an online survey. Analysis of the CFQ resulted in 5 factorially-derived subscales, an interference scale, and an additional subscale measure of fear of cesarean delivery. The 6 CFQ subscales and the interference scale demonstrated good internal consistency, as well as convergent and discriminant validity. The CFQ represents the most comprehensive measure of fear of childbirth currently available, and can facilitate screening for fear of childbirth as well as identification of specific fear domains to be targeted in treatment. 

# Measures and original domains

We initially developed 49 item Childbirth Fear Questionnaire (CFQ) covering the following domains of potential childbirth-related fear:  
* social embarrassment (e.g., fear of losing control)  
* pain (i.e., fear of pain), pain medication (e.g., fear of not receiving the pain medication one is hoping for)  
* mode of delivery (e.g., fear of a cesarean delivery)  
* baby’s and mother’s physical safety (e.g., fear that one’s infant may be harmed or die during labour/delivery)  
* changes to one’s body (e.g., scarring)  
* sexual functioning (e.g., enjoying sexual activity less following delivery)  
* and medical interventions (e.g., fear of having an episiotomy).

All CFQ items are scored on a 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) point, Likert-type scale.

# Results

- [Appendix A](https://raw.githack.com/andkov/fear-of-childbirth/master/reports/appendix-a/appendix-a.html) : Item elimination and model testing of Orthogonal Bifactor solution with 6 factors. ([.docx format](https://rawgit.com/andkov/fear-of-childbirth/master/reports/appendix-a/appendix-a.docx))
- [Appendix B](https://raw.githack.com/andkov/fear-of-childbirth/master/reports/appendix-b/appendix-b.html) : Factor patterns from various rotation from the original 49 items of FCQ and various number of factor extracted
- [Appendix C](https://raw.githack.com/andkov/fear-of-childbirth/master/reports/appendix-c/appendix-c.html) :  Descriptives of the original scale variables and covariates. ([.docx format](https://rawgit.com/andkov/fear-of-childbirth/master/reports/appendix-c/appendix-c.docx))

After eigen analysis and examination of factor patterns, we have settled on a orthogonal bifactor solution (with one general factor and 5 subscales) as the best fitting and the most interpretable. The final simple solution (with trivial loadings masked for clarity) is displayed below:
