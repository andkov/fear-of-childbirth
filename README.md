# Abstract
#### Introduction
Currently available measures of fear of childbirth fail to fully capture women’s childbirth-related fears (e.g., important content domains excluded). The purpose of this research was to develop a new measure of fear of childbirth (the Childbirth Fear Questionnaire; CFQ) that would address the limitations of existing measures.

#### Methods
Participants were 643 pregnant women residing in English speaking countries, and were recruited via online forums. Participants completed a set of questionnaires, including the CFQ, via an online survey.

#### Results
Analysis of the CFQ resulted in 6 factorially-derived subscales, and an interference scale. The 6 CFQ subscales and the interference scale demonstrated good internal consistency, as well as convergent and discriminant validity.

#### Discussion
The CFQ represents the most comprehensive measure of fear of childbirth currently available. We hope this new measure proves useful to identify women with elevated fear of childbirth.

#### Measures and original domains

We initially developed 49 items covering the following domains of potential childbirth-related fear:  
* social embarrassment (e.g., fear of losing control)  
* pain (i.e., fear of pain), pain medication (e.g., fear of not receiving the pain medication one is hoping for)  
* mode of delivery (e.g., fear of a cesarean delivery)  
* baby’s and mother’s physical safety (e.g., fear that one’s infant may be harmed or die during labour/delivery)  
* changes to one’s body (e.g., scarring)  
* sexual functioning (e.g., enjoying sexual activity less following delivery)  
* and medical interventions (e.g., fear of having an episiotomy).

CFQ items are scored on a 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) point, Likert-type scale.

### Analysis

- [Phase 0](https://rawgit.com/andkov/fear-of-childbirth/master/reports/extract-and-eliminate/extract-and-eliminate-0.html) : original 49 items
- [Phase 1](https://rawgit.com/andkov/fear-of-childbirth/master/reports/extract-and-eliminate/extract-and-eliminate-1.html) : removing items that didn't load well on any of the factors, namely : 5, 16, 18, 45, 49
