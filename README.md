# Abstract
#### Introduction
Currently available measures of fear of childbirth fail to fully capture womenâ€™s childbirth-related fears (e.g., important content domains excluded). The purpose of this research was to develop a new measure of fear of childbirth (the Childbirth Fear Questionnaire; CFQ) that would address the limitations of existing measures.

#### Methods
Participants were 643 pregnant women residing in English speaking countries, and were recruited via online forums. Participants completed a set of questionnaires, including the CFQ, via an online survey.

#### Results
Analysis of the CFQ resulted in 6 factorially-derived subscales, and an interference scale. The 6 CFQ subscales and the interference scale demonstrated good internal consistency, as well as convergent and discriminant validity.

#### Discussion
The CFQ represents the most comprehensive measure of fear of childbirth currently available. We hope this new measure proves useful to identify women with elevated fear of childbirth.
